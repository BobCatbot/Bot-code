# BobCat-Bot

Well let me start from the beginning, a bobcat was originally thought of by my sister back in 2019, and we both has an idea to create a bot called "Bobcat commands".  Bobcat was brought to life by creating him a profile picture and a name, and started coding in python, at this time in 2019 I was still in school and had no experience in coding in python!

From this time I tried to learn python well... That did not go to plan and my idea did not go to plan.  So bobcat was put on hold as I was still in school and has no experience whats so ever, until 2021.

I restarted bobcat around the middle of July and did not succeed with him as I did not have any ideas what to do, or how to start! 
Until now...
At the ending of July and the starting of august I asked for help on a server, I join months ago and recently got accepted for trial moderator.

On the server, they had a welcome bot and thought "That would be an amazing thing to have in my server" so I asked in the chat if there was a way to add the bot to my server?
Then about 3-4 days later I got a response from a higher-ranked moderator saying they could recreate the bot, and omg my brain right then was like "omg someone is so amazing to recreate a bot and be able to bring bobcat back to life  !!!!" 

After we decided what to do with bobcat my amazing friend "Tech" had an idea to let bobcat have commands to moderate the server, ( because at that time I had loads of bots ) this was going to help the server a lot because I could reduce the bots and have my very own bot.  So time went on for a month sorting out bobcat how he worked how he looked and we finally got to a point where we loved it.
